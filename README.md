# Full Stack Coffe Shop API

## Introduction

This project is a coffee shop app that allows users visitors to view drinks, baristas can view drinks and see ingredients and managers can create, edit, and update drinks.

Backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### Installing Backend Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

It is generally recommended, but not required, to use a virtual environment.

[python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

### Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=api.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

### Testing

To run the tests, create a sqlite database called `test_drinks.py` and add a single drink. Change `self.manager_token` and `self.barista_token` in test_drinks.py to valid tokens. Then, from the /src directory run

```
python test_drinks.py
```

### Installing Frontend Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing Ionic Cli

The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI is in the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Required Tasks

### Configure Enviornment Variables

Ionic uses a configuration file to manage environment variables. These variables ship with the transpiled software and should not include secrets.

- Open `./src/environments/environments.ts` and ensure each variable reflects the system you stood up for the backend.

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

Ionic ships with a useful development server which detects changes and transpiles as you work. The application is then accessible through the browser on a localhost port. To run the development server, cd into the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
ionic serve
```

> _tip_: Do not use **ionic serve** in production. Instead, build Ionic into a build artifact for your desired platforms.
> [Checkout the Ionic docs to learn more](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/build)

### Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Error are returned as JSON objects in the following format

```
{
'message':'Bad request',
'error': 400,
'success':False
}
```

The API will return four error types when requests fail:

- 404
- 409
- 422
- 500

### Endpoint Library

#### Get /questions

- General:

  - Returns a list of question objects, success value, list of categories, total number of questions,
    and current catefory.
  - Results are paginated in groups of 10. Include a request argument to choose page number, starting from 1.

- Sample: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions`
